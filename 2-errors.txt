Slide 1: Introduction to SQL Injection
Title: Introduction to SQL Injection
Content:
Definition: "SQL Injection is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database."
Impact Overview: Briefly discuss how SQL Injection can allow attackers to access and manipulate sensitive data, potentially leading to identity theft, loss of data, and a breach of trust.
Slide 2: History of SQL Injection
Title: History of SQL Injection
Content:
Key Milestones: Outline the discovery and evolution of SQL Injection, perhaps starting from its first major documentation in the late 1990s.
Notable Examples: Provide a few real-world incidents, such as the 2009 RockYou breach where over 32 million passwords were exposed through SQL Injection.
Slide 3: How SQL Injection Works
Title: How SQL Injection Works
Content:
Diagram: Include a simple flowchart or diagram showing how SQL code is typically processed in a web application.
Code Comparison: Show side-by-side examples of vulnerable SQL code versus secure SQL code to highlight common mistakes and best practices.
Slide 4: Types of SQL Injection Attacks
Title: Types of SQL Injection Attacks
Content:
T-SQL Injection: Explain how attackers manipulate T-SQL specific code to execute illicit commands.
Blind SQL Injection: Discuss how attackers can infer database information from the behavior of the application despite not seeing data from the database directly.
Out-of-Band SQL Injection: Explain methods involving data transmission over different protocols to retrieve information.
Slide 5: Importance of Preventing SQL Injection
Title: Importance of Preventing SQL Injection
Content:
