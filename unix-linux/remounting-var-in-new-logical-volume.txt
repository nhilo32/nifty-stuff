BEFORE YOU BEGIN!!!! make sure you have the root password. Not sudo... the root password...
if you only have sudo, you MIGHT be able to copy the /etc/shadow file change the password
and then either restore the shadow file when finished or copy the hash from the old shadow
file into the new one for the root user.


1. Go to single usermode

init 1


2. rename /var/log to /var/log_hold

mv /var/log /var/log_hold


3. create filesystem to mount to.

mkdir /var/log


4. find logical volume group within which to build the logical volume

vgdisplay


5. create, format (to ext4) and mount logical volume


lvcreate -n log -L 3G vg_phl1s432

-n log = name of the logical volume
-L 3G = size of the logical volume
data_phl1s432 = name of the volume group

mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg_phl1s432/log

mount /dev/vg_phl1s432/log /var/log

edit the /etc/fstab to make changes and mounting permanant

/dev/vg_phl1s432/log		/var/log		ext4	defaults	1 2


6. copy everything from /var/log_hold to /var/log

cp /var/log_hold/* /var/log/


7. resync selinux

restorecon -vr /var


8. reboot

reboot


For /var/log/audit you can query what processes are using that directory. Probably just auditd. You can just 
shutdown the service or kill the processes. Then start from step 2.

lsof +D /var/log/audit


Problems: 

messed up /etc/fstab:
if you screw up the /etc/fstab you will need to do the following
After rebooting will be prompted for the root password.
Enter it.
Edit the /etc/fstab to remove the offending line. You may have to remount the root file system if /etc in on it.
You can do that with the following command.
mount -o remount,rw /
It is also possible you will have to remount from one run level or more up. This can be accomplished by manually 
mounting with above mount command and then using the init command to move up a level.


Permissions error after rebooting or processes not logging to the new directory. try the below command again 
and reboot.

restorecon -vr /var
