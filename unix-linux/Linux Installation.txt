Linux Installation

 

1. Set the grub password.

To do this manually after the OS is installed.
- execute the grub-md5-crypt command and copy the resulting hash
- edit the /boot/grub/grub.conf file. After the "splashimage" line enter the following line "password --md5 md5-hash-you-copied"

2. Choose Custom layout. Build the following mount points.
/ 20GB ext3
/var 20 GB ext3 (this is optional, but Linux keeps most of its log files here, if it has its own mount point it one of them can blow up without taking the OS with it) 
/tmp 20 GB ext3 (I believe STIG mandates a seperate mount point for temp) 
/swap swap(at least as big as the amount of RAM on the system)
/oracle 20 GB ext3 (this is a minimum 10 would be better)
/u00-03 20 GB 3xt3 (this only needs to be as big as your databases are now and will be in the forseeable future.

3. Choose software to install. Select "Basic Server" at the top and "Customize Now" at the bottom and then choose the following in the configuration Base System - keep everyting that is already checked and add "Compatibility Libraries"
Servers - check system administration tools Web Services - nothing Databases - nothing System Management - nothing Virtualization - nothing Desktops - check Desptop, General Purpose Desktop, X Windows System, Graphical Administration Tools, in optional packages select system-config-kickstart Applications - nothing Development - check Additional Development, Desktop Platform Development, Development Tools, Server Platform Development
- you probably don't need anything here other than all the gcc stufff (gcc, gcc-c++, gcc-devel and whatnot) Languages - nothing


4. create the dba group and the create the oracle user as part of the dba group.

5. change ownership of the /oracle and /uu0 to the oracle user and dba group.

6. Execute the SRR commands.

 

SRR Commands

# trap decode to catch security attacks
# decode: root

Comment out users shutdown and halt in the /etc/passwd file.


2. Remove users halt and shutdown.

Httpd and samba elements seem to get installed somehow despite not being selected during installation.
Find out what version it is and remove it.
