How to Change the UI Font Size for Oracle SQL Developer

And here’s where to set that property

In Windows, you want to to go to the Application Data, Roaming Users directory that stores the settings files for SQL Developer. On my machine that’s here:
C:\Users\jdsmith\AppData\Roaming\SQL Developer\system4.1.0.13.75\o.sqldeveloper.12.2.0.13.75

Mine for version 19.
C:\Users\hed0425\AppData\Roaming\SQL Developer\system19.1.0.094.2042\o.sqldeveloper


Note: my version string at the end might be a different than yours depending on your version of SQL Developer.

You want to open ide.properties. You’ll notice it is VERY well documented. There’s a section that speaks to Windows in particular. To change the default size for all look and feels, add this line, the uncommented one:

# To modify the font size for a particular locale under all
# look-and-feels, set the Ide.FontSize.<languageID> property. For
# example:
Ide.FontSize.en=14

Mine, I set english fontsize to 16:
Ide.FontSize.en=16

If you think 14 looks huge, one of my co-workers has his set to 21!
This doesn’t control the font size for text in the editors and the data grids

We have a preference in the UI for that.
